**Welcome to the API Security Village Hackathon at BSidesSF 2024!**

**Event Theme: "You can't spell dystopia without AI"**

Join us on May 4-5, 2024, at City View at Metreon, San Francisco, for an exhilarating hackathon event focused on the cutting edge of API and AI security. This hackathon is designed to challenge and inspire you to develop innovative solutions to some of the most pressing issues in today's digital landscape.

**Hackathon Themes:**
Got it! You have selected four diverse and compelling themes for your hackathon, each with a focus on crucial aspects of AI and API security. Here's how you can present these themes in your registration form or promotional materials to engage potential participants effectively:

### Hackathon Themes Description

1. **AI in Cyber Defense: Building the Next-Gen Blue Team**
   - **Description**: Develop AI-driven solutions that can predict, detect, and respond to cyber threats in real-time. Your challenge is to create systems that can adapt to evolving threats and significantly reduce false positives in anomaly detection. Ideal solutions will demonstrate robustness, scalability, and a keen understanding of potential cyber threats.

2. **Ethical AI: Safeguarding Privacy and Fairness in AI Applications**
   - **Description**: This challenge requires you to craft AI solutions that prioritize user privacy and data security. Focus on implementing robust data anonymization techniques and creating fairness algorithms to prevent bias in AI decision-making. Solutions should ensure compliance with global privacy standards and exhibit fairness across diverse demographic groups.

3. **GraphQL Security Innovations**
   - **Description**: Develop security mechanisms for GraphQL APIs to prevent common vulnerabilities and unauthorized data exposure. Your innovations should address key security flaws such as injection attacks, excessive data retrieval, and improper authentication and authorization practices.

4. **Securing AI Serialization Processes**
   - **Description**: Tackle the security risks associated with AI model serialization, with a particular focus on preventing exploits like those found in Pythonâ€™s pickle module. Propose methods to securely serialize and deserialize data, ensuring that AI models remain tamper-proof and resistant to adversarial attacks.

**Why Participate?**
- **Collaborate and Network**: Work alongside peers and industry leaders who are passionate about security.
- **Showcase Your Skills**: Whether you're a beginner or an expert, this is a chance to showcase your skills and make an impact.
- **Win Prizes**: Exciting prizes await the best solutions, along with opportunities to present your work to security professionals and potential employers.

**Event Details:**
